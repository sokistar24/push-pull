=== Cross-Validation (5-fold) ===
Mean accuracy: 0.9625
Std deviation: 0.0017

=== Model Comparison (Basic vs Full Features) ===
Basic accuracy: 0.9475
Full accuracy:  0.9642
Accuracy difference: 0.0167
Performance loss (% of full): 1.73%
Interpretation: Basic features provide comparable performance and are suitable for edge deployment.

=== Edge Device Suitability ===
Input features: 3 (accx, accy, accz)
Tree depth: 12
Number of nodes: 55
Number of leaves: 28

Computational requirements:
- Feature computation: None (raw sensor values only)
- Approximate maximum number of comparisons: 55
- Approximate memory footprint: 1.3 KB

Suitability: Good for edge deployment; inference is fast for most devices.
